| [Double Descent Demystified: Rethinking Model Complexity in Machine Learning](https://garyuppal.github.io/posts/double_descent/) | [double_descent_overview](./double_descent_overview/) | This post explores the double descent phenomenon using a simple linear regression example. It highlights recent insights from Curth et al. (2023), showing how an effective complexity measure can recover the classic bias-variance trade-off. The post concludes with reflections on open questions and future directions. |
